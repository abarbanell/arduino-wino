This is a short descrition how to measure soil humidity in your plants with a [wino-board](http://wino-board.com).

(note, this post is not yet complete...)

# Setting up

Just check my [previous post](http://blog.abarbanell.de/arduino-wino/arduino/2015/11/05/wino-unbox.html).

# first try

The code for my first trial sketch is [here](https://github.com/abarbanell/arduino-wino/sketch_soil), I will add more 
sketches for this board soon.

# Still to do

the measurement data should be sent regularly via a REST API to my [limitless garden](https://github.com/abarbanell/limitless-garden) server and to my 
[statsd/ Grafana server](https://github.com/abarbanell/docker-grafana-graphite)
